# Agent Interaction Protocols

## Overview
This document defines the communication protocols between different agent types in the assembly line system. All agents will use SPADE's FIPA-compliant protocols for standardized communication.

## Protocol Types

### 1. Material Transfer Protocol
**Purpose**: Coordinate the transfer of materials between conveyor belts, cranes, and assembly stations.

**Message Flow**:
1. **RequestTransfer**: Source agent sends a request to transfer materials
2. **ConfirmTransfer**: Target agent confirms readiness to receive materials
3. **ExecuteTransfer**: Source agent initiates the transfer
4. **TransferComplete**: Target agent confirms successful receipt

**Example (Conveyor Belt to Crane)**:
```plaintext
ConveyorBelt --> Crane: RequestTransfer(material_id, quantity, destination)
Crane --> ConveyorBelt: ConfirmTransfer(ready_time)
ConveyorBelt --> Crane: ExecuteTransfer(start_time)
Crane --> ConveyorBelt: TransferComplete(status)
```

### 2. Task Assignment Protocol
**Purpose**: Assign specific tasks to agents based on current workload and priorities.

**Message Flow**:
1. **AssignTask**: Central coordinator sends task assignment
2. **AcceptTask**: Agent accepts the task with estimated completion time
3. **CompleteTask**: Agent reports task completion

**Example (Central Coordinator to Robotic Arm)**:
```plaintext
Coordinator --> RoboticArm: AssignTask(task_id, components, deadline)
RoboticArm --> Coordinator: AcceptTask(estimated_time)
RoboticArm --> Coordinator: CompleteTask(status, actual_time)
```

### 3. Status Update Protocol
**Purpose**: Regular status updates between agents to maintain situational awareness.

**Message Flow**:
1. **StatusUpdate**: Agent sends current status at regular intervals
2. **Acknowledge**: Receiver acknowledges receipt of status

**Example (All Agents)**:
```plaintext
AgentX --> Coordinator: StatusUpdate(operational_status, inventory_levels)
Coordinator --> AgentX: Acknowledge(receipt_time)
```

### 4. Emergency Protocol
**Purpose**: Handle unexpected events or failures in the assembly line.

**Message Flow**:
1. **RaiseAlert**: Agent detects an issue and raises an alert
2. **AcknowledgeAlert**: Coordinator acknowledges the alert
3. **ResolveAlert**: Agent or maintenance team reports resolution

**Example (Crane to Coordinator)**:
```plaintext
Crane --> Coordinator: RaiseAlert(issue_type, severity, location)
Coordinator --> Crane: AcknowledgeAlert(ack_time)
Maintenance --> Coordinator: ResolveAlert(resolution_time, notes)
```

### 5. Learning Data Exchange Protocol
**Purpose**: Share successful strategies and experiences between agents.

**Message Flow**:
1. **ShareExperience**: Agent shares successful experience with others
2. **AcknowledgeShare**: Receiver acknowledges receipt of experience data

**Example (Robotic Arm to Other Robotic Arms)**:
```plaintext
Arm1 --> Arm2: ShareExperience(task_type, strategy, reward)
Arm2 --> Arm1: AcknowledgeShare(receipt_time)
```

## Communication Patterns

### Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
- Used for broadcasting status updates and alerts
- All agents subscribe to relevant topics (e.g., "material_availability", "system_alerts")

### Request-Response Pattern
- Used for specific requests that require confirmation
- Examples: Material transfers, task assignments

### Contract Net Protocol (CNP)
- Used for dynamic task allocation
- Coordinator announces tasks, agents bid based on capacity
- Most suitable agent is selected for each task

## Protocol Implementation

### SPADE Message Structure
All messages will follow this basic structure:
```python
message = Message(to=receiver_jid,
                  body=json.dumps(message_content),
                  subject=protocol_type)
```

### Protocol Types
- `material_transfer`: For Material Transfer Protocol
- `task_assignment`: For Task Assignment Protocol
- `status_update`: For Status Update Protocol
- `emergency_alert`: For Emergency Protocol
- `learning_data`: For Learning Data Exchange Protocol

## Error Handling

### Common Errors:
1. **Timeout**: No response received within expected timeframe
2. **Refusal**: Agent refuses to perform requested action
3. **Failure**: Agent reports failure during execution

### Error Response Format:
```plaintext
AgentX --> Requester: ErrorResponse(error_code, error_message, timestamp)
```

### Error Codes:
- `001`: Timeout
- `002`: Refusal
- `003`: Execution Failure
- `004`: Invalid Request Format

## Security Considerations
- All messages should be signed and encrypted
- Implement access control for sensitive operations
- Use secure channels for communication between agents

## Implementation Plan
1. Define message schemas for each protocol type
2. Implement message handlers in each agent class
3. Set up SPADE behaviors for processing incoming messages
4. Integrate protocols with RLlib components for learning-based decision making
5. Test protocols in simulation environment

## Protocol Testing Strategy
- Simulate normal operation scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify interoperability between different agent types
- Measure communication latency and throughput

This comprehensive protocol design ensures that all agents in the assembly line can communicate effectively, coordinate their actions, and learn from each other to optimize the overall production process.
