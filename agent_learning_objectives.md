## Shared Learning Objectives Across All Agents:
1. **Collaboration**: Learn to coordinate actions with other agents
2. **Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on changing conditions or new objectives
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize operations to minimize energy consumption
4. **Safety**: Prioritize safe operations over speed or efficiency when conflicts arise

## Learning Approach:
- **On-policy learning**: Agents learn while actively participating in operations
- **Curriculum learning**: Start with simple tasks, gradually increase complexity
- **Transfer learning**: Share successful strategies between similar agents
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning**: Agents learn to cooperate and compete in a shared environment

## Implementation Considerations:
- Each agent type will have its own RLlib policy network
- Shared value networks can be used for common objectives like safety and energy efficiency
- Experience replay buffers will store successful strategies for each agent type
