# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Assembly Line System. The goal is to ensure that all components work together effectively and that agents learn optimal behaviors.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all components and interactions
2. **Automation**: Use automated tests for repeatability
3. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate testing into the development workflow
4. **Realism**: Test scenarios that mimic real-world conditions

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
**Purpose**: Validate individual components in isolation.

#### Test Areas:
- **Environment Components**: Stations, materials, state management
- **Agent Classes**: Base agent functionality, specific agent behaviors
- **Protocols**: Message creation and parsing
- **RLlib Models**: Neural network architecture, forward pass

#### Example Tests:
```python
def test_material_creation():
    material = Material("mat1", "metal", 5.0, "assembly_1")
    assert material.location == "raw_materials"
    assert material.status == "available"

def test_conveyor_agent_initialization():
    agent = ConveyorAgent("conveyor_1", "jid", "password", env)
    assert agent.agent_id == "conveyor_1"
    assert agent.speed == 1.0
```

### 2. Integration Testing
**Purpose**: Verify interactions between components.

#### Test Areas:
- **Agent-Environment Interface**: Action execution and observation collection
- **Communication Protocols**: Message passing between agents
- **RLlib Integration**: Policy network inputs and outputs

#### Example Tests:
```python
def test_agent_environment_interaction():
    env = AssemblyLineEnv()
    obs = env.reset()

    actions = {"conveyor_1": 0}
    new_obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(actions)

    assert len(new_obs) > 0
    assert "conveyor_1" in rewards

def test_material_transfer_protocol():
    msg = MaterialTransferProtocol.create_request_message(
        "source", "target@localhost", "mat1", 3, "destination"
    )
    assert msg.to == "target@localhost"
    assert msg.subject == MaterialTransferProtocol.REQUEST_TRANSFER
```

### 3. System Testing
**Purpose**: Validate the complete assembly line system.

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Normal Operation**: Standard production flow
2. **High Demand**: Peak load conditions
3. **Maintenance**: Simulated equipment downtime
4. **Quality Issues**: Defective materials in the system

#### Key Metrics:
- Throughput rate
- System efficiency
- Quality control performance
- Agent coordination quality

### 4. Performance Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure the system meets performance requirements.

#### Test Areas:
- **Simulation Speed**: Time per time step
- **Scalability**: Performance with increased agents/stations
- **Resource Usage**: CPU/memory utilization

#### Benchmarks:
- Real-time factor (simulation speed vs. wall clock time)
- Maximum agents supported
- Memory footprint per agent

## Validation Approach

### 1. Learning Validation
**Purpose**: Verify that agents are learning effectively.

#### Metrics to Track:
- Policy loss over time
- Action distribution changes
- Reward signals received

#### Validation Methods:
1. **Learning Curves**: Plot reward and loss over training episodes
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Compare action distributions before/after training
3. **Policy Comparison**: Evaluate against random or heuristic baselines

### 2. Coordination Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure agents work together effectively.

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Material Hand-off**: Verify smooth transfers between agents
2. **Task Allocation**: Test dynamic task distribution
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Validate handling of competing requests

#### Metrics:
- Successful hand-offs percentage
- Task completion time
- Conflict resolution rate

### 3. Robustness Testing
**Purpose**: Validate system behavior under adverse conditions.

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Agent Failure**: Simulate agent crashes
2. **Network Issues**: Test with delayed or lost messages
3. **Extreme Conditions**: High demand, low resources

#### Metrics:
- System recovery time
- Performance degradation
- Failure detection and handling

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Test Environment Setup
