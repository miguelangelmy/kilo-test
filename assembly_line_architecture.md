# Assembly Line System Architecture

## Overview
This system simulates an assembly line where different types of agents work together to assemble products from raw materials. The system uses SPADE for agent communication and RLlib for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Agent Types

### 1. Conveyor Belt Agent
- **Function**: Transports materials between different stations
- **Learning Objective**: Optimize transport routes and speeds to minimize delays
- **RLlib Components**:
  - Policy Network: Determines optimal transport paths
  - Value Network: Evaluates state values for route planning

### 2. Crane Agent
- **Function**: Moves heavy objects between areas
- **Learning Objective**: Optimize lifting and placement operations
- **RLlib Components**:
  - Value Network: Estimates optimal lift points
  - Experience Replay Buffer: Stores successful lifting patterns

### 3. Robotic Arm Agent
- **Function**: Performs precise assembly tasks
- **Learning Objective**: Improve assembly precision and speed
- **RLlib Components**:
  - Policy Network: Determines optimal movement patterns
  - Experience Replay Buffer: Learns from successful assembly attempts

### 4. Assembly Station Agent
- **Function**: Assembles final products from components
- **Learning Objective**: Optimize assembly sequences and resource usage
- **RLlib Components**:
  - Policy Network: Determines optimal assembly sequences
  - Value Network: Evaluates state values for resource allocation

## System Components

### SPADE Infrastructure
- **Agent Platform**: Manages agent lifecycle and communication
- **Message Queue**: Handles inter-agent messaging
- **FIPA Compliant Protocols**: Ensures standardized agent communication

### RLlib Infrastructure
- **Policy Network**: Central component for decision making in all agents
- **Value Network**: Estimates state values for reinforcement learning
- **Experience Replay Buffer**: Stores and replays experiences for learning

## Interaction Protocols
- Agents communicate using SPADE's FIPA protocols
- Conveyor belts signal when materials are ready for transfer
- Cranes request lifting operations based on material location
- Robotic arms coordinate with assembly stations for component placement
- Assembly stations manage the final product assembly sequence

## Learning Approach
- **On-policy learning**: Agents learn while actively participating in the assembly process
- **Shared experience pool**: Agents can share successful experiences to accelerate learning
- **Curriculum learning**: Start with simple tasks, gradually increase complexity

## Simulation Environment
- Discrete time steps representing assembly line operations
- State representation includes material locations, agent positions, and assembly progress
- Reward signals based on task completion time, resource usage, and product quality

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up SPADE agent platform
2. Implement basic agent communication protocols
3. Develop RLlib models for each agent type
4. Create simulation environment with reward functions
5. Integrate agents and RLlib components
6. Test and validate the system
